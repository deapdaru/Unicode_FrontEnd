Project 1: Portfolio Webpage

A static portfolio site of me created using HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript.
It is made mobile-responsive first and I have added 2 breakpoints(for tablets and laptops) using media queries.
'Contact Me' page has various form validation using JS and tweaking CSS style using JS.
